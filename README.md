# source codes used for DynMat 

The source codes used for DynMat (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2019.04.005) are stored for the future reference.

In this repository, source codes used for testing 3 digits of MNIST set are provided. 

1. mnist_norm.py: prepare MNIST dataset for experiments
2. DynMat_export.py: run experiments and save results
3. data_analyzer.py, comp_thres.py and comp_thres4.py: examples of analysis codes

## Notes

1. All codes were written for pytorch0.3; Variables class were used. 
2. It is meant to run with GPU. To run it without GPU, a few tweaks are necessary. 
3. Unfortunately, the current repository does not provide detailed instructions, and codes do not have proper annotations. Hopefully, it will be improved over time.
